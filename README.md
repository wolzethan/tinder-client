# node-basic
Basic beginning structure for new node app

## Installation
In order to install this application you will first need to have NodeJs installed.  You can get Node from [here](http://nodejs.org)

- Once you have node installed and the repository cloned you need to run

```
  npm install
```

  this will install the necessary packages for the App into the 'node_modules' repository.

- since this is connected to a MongoDB in localhost you will need to make sure you have MongoDB installed.
- Once installed you need to make sure it is running by running the command

```
  mongod
```

## Running the App

- If everything in the previous steps went well you should be able to run the app by running

```
  node index.js
```

If you see *BABY CEREBRO RUNNING ON 5000* Everything is working correctly
 - have fun playing with your new test app!
